# Age-and-Gender-Detection-using-OpenCV-Python-APPARKY

> 
> In this Python Project, we have used OpenCV to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face. 
> The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following 
> ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100) . 
> It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image because of factors like makeup, 
> lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions. 
> And so, we make this a classification problem instead of making it one of regression.    
> 
> OpenCV is short for Open Source Computer Vision. Intuitively by the name, it is an open-source Computer Vision and 
> Machine Learning library. This library is capable of processing real-time image and video while also boasting 
> analytical capabilities.
